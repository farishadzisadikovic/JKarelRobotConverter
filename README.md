# JKarelRobotConverter

JKarelRobot Converter Stage 1:

This program will be able to convert a Karel world file 
to a Jarel file, and vice versa. As of right now, it will 
be working on a command line as the previous C++ version.
It will be able to identify wether it is a Karel or Jarel world file, 
but also it will be taking directories of Karel and Jarel world files.

Karel and Jarel Project Stage 2:

After a successful conversion from C++ to Python, we will have a program 
that works on a same basis as the previous version in C++. In this stage 
we will start the process of creating a GUI Desktop application.
